Quick Recipes for Problem Solving

#### General thoughts

Something to remember is many STL functions can be applied
for several containers. Remember this. 
Eg: count() can be used for vector and strings like Counter() in python.   
    Like that find_end, find_first_of can be applied.
    
    
Some key things to remember when starting off:        
1. begin() and end() are used for iterators  
2. front() and back() are used for - looking up  
3. unordered_map is faster 
4. map sorts by key by default    
5. iterator to index  -> it - v.begin() instead of std::distance()
